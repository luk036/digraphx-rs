# Gemini Code Assistant Report

## Project: digraphx-rs

### Overview

`digraphx-rs` is a Rust library that provides a collection of network optimization algorithms. The project is built using Rust and leverages the `petgraph` library for graph data structures and algorithms. The core of the library focuses on finding negative cycles in directed graphs and includes implementations of the Bellman-Ford and Howard's algorithms. It also features a parametric search framework for solving problems that can be modeled as finding a minimum or maximum ratio in a graph.

The library is designed to be generic and can be used with different numeric types, including rational numbers, to ensure precision in calculations. The code is well-documented with examples and includes a suite of unit tests to ensure correctness.

### Building and Running

The project uses Cargo, the standard Rust build tool and package manager.

**Building the project:**

```bash
cargo build
```

**Running tests:**

```bash
cargo test
```

**Running benchmarks:**

```bash
cargo bench
```

**Running examples:**

```bash
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

### Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The code follows standard Rust conventions and formatting, which is likely enforced by `rustfmt`.
*   **Testing:** The project has a comprehensive test suite in the `tests` directory. Tests are written using the built-in Rust testing framework.
*   **Dependencies:** The project uses `petgraph` for graph data structures and `num` for numeric traits. Dependencies are managed in `Cargo.toml`.
*   **Continuous Integration:** The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, with workflows for building, testing, and code coverage analysis.
